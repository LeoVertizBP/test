# Management Components

This section documents components used in the administrative sections for managing core entities, found in `frontend/src/components/management`. This includes components for managing Advertisers, Products, Publishers, Rules, Rule Sets, and Users, as well as associated modals for CRUD operations.

*(Documentation for components like `AdvertiserManagement.tsx`, `ProductManagement.tsx`, `RuleSetManagement.tsx`, `AddAdvertiserModal.tsx`, etc., will be added here based on code analysis.)*
