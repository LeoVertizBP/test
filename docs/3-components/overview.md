# Frontend Components Overview

This section documents the reusable React components used in the frontend application (`frontend/src/components`). Components are organized based on their feature area or purpose.

## Component Groups

*   **[Authentication](./auth.md):** Components related to user login, session management, and protecting routes.
*   **[Common](./common.md):** General-purpose, reusable UI elements used across multiple features (e.g., modals, form fields, buttons).
*   **[Dashboard](./dashboard.md):** Components specifically designed for displaying metrics and visualizations on the main dashboard.
*   **[Flag Review](./flag-review.md):** Components used in the interface for viewing, filtering, and reviewing compliance flags.
*   **[Layout](./layout.md):** Components responsible for the overall page structure, navigation, and persistent UI elements (e.g., navigation bars, sidebars).
*   **[Management](./management.md):** Components used in the administrative sections for managing core entities like Advertisers, Products, Publishers, Rules, Rule Sets, and Users. Includes forms and modals for CRUD operations.
*   **[Reports](./reports.md):** Components dedicated to displaying generated reports or report data.
*   **[Scan](./scan.md):** Components related to initiating and potentially monitoring scan jobs.

Refer to the specific markdown file for each group for detailed documentation on the components within that category.
