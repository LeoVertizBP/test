# State Management (Frontend)

## Overview

This document outlines the approach to managing state within the Next.js frontend application of the Credit Compliance Tool. State management refers to how the application stores, updates, and shares data across different components and pages.

## Key Concepts

*   **Client-Side State:** Data that exists and changes within the user's browser during their session. This includes UI state (e.g., form inputs, modal visibility, toggles) and potentially cached data fetched from the server.
*   **Server-Side State:** Data that originates from the backend server and is fetched via API calls. While the frontend might cache or display this data, the source of truth resides on the server.
*   **Global State:** State that needs to be accessed or modified by multiple, potentially unrelated, components across the application (e.g., user authentication status).
*   **Local State:** State that is confined to a single component or a small group of related components.

## Implementation Approach

Based on the project's dependencies (`frontend/package.json`), the frontend does **not** appear to use dedicated third-party state management libraries like Redux, Zustand, Jotai, or TanStack Query (React Query).

Therefore, state management likely relies on a combination of:

1.  **React Hooks:**
    *   **`useState`:** Used extensively for managing component-local state (e.g., form values, UI element states).
    *   **`useReducer`:** Potentially used for more complex local state logic within components or closely related component trees.
    *   **`useContext` + `createContext`:** Likely used for managing global or shared state that needs to be accessible across different parts of the application without excessive prop drilling (e.g., user authentication status, theme settings).

2.  **Next.js Features (App Router assumed):**
    *   **Server Components:** If the App Router is used, Server Components fetch data directly on the server, reducing the need to manage server state (like fetched data, loading, and error states) explicitly on the client. Data is passed down as props.
    *   **Client Components:** Use React Hooks (`useState`, `useContext`, etc.) for managing interactive UI state and client-side logic.
    *   **Caching:** Next.js provides built-in caching mechanisms for data fetched in Server Components or via Route Handlers, which can minimize redundant data fetching.

3.  **Prop Drilling:** For simpler cases where state needs to be shared between a parent and a few levels of child components, passing state down via props might be used.

### Data Fetching State

*   **`axios`:** This library is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
*   **Loading/Error States:** Components that fetch data using `axios` (likely within Client Components or potentially using `useEffect` in older patterns) will typically manage their own loading and error states using `useState`.

        ContextHook[useContext] --> GlobalState(Shared Global State);
        FetchLogic[Data Fetching (axios)] --> LoadingErrorState[useState for Loading/Error];
        FetchLogic --> ServerDataCache(Cached Server Data);
    end

    subgraph "Server Component (App Router)"
        ServerFetch[Direct Data Fetching] --> ServerDataProps(Data passed as Props);
    end

    subgraph "Context API"
        ContextProvider[Context Provider] --> GlobalState;
    end

    ServerDataProps --> ClientComponent;
    ClientComponent --> ContextHook;
    ClientComponent --> StateHook;
    ClientComponent --> FetchLogic;

```

## Integration Points

*   **React Context API:** Used to provide global state values down the component tree.
*   **API Service Layer (Frontend):** Likely a set of functions (potentially in `frontend/src/services/`) that use `axios` to interact with the backend API and are called by components to fetch or update data.
*   **Next.js Router:** Navigation events might trigger state changes or data re-fetching.

## Best Practices

*   **Prefer Local State:** Use component-local state (`useState`) whenever possible.
*   **Use Context Judiciously:** Employ React Context for genuinely global state or state shared across distant parts of the component tree. Avoid overusing Context, as it can lead to performance issues if not implemented carefully.
*   **Leverage Next.js:** Utilize Server Components and Next.js caching mechanisms effectively to handle server state and reduce client-side complexity, especially if using the App Router.
*   **Consistent Data Fetching:** Implement a consistent pattern for fetching data, handling loading states, and managing errors within components that need to interact with the API.
